  `When people ask me "what kind of things do you paint?" I have so much trouble answering. I'll scramble to find the closest approximation I can, and usually end up rambling for far too long. I have so much trouble because the objects that I paint are not what I'm really painting. I'm trying to capture the act of creation itself. But that's not a sufficient answer to their question. That tells you very little.`,
  `So I thought I'd try to tell you more.`,
  `I'm fascinated with the liminal states of things, objects and people in transition. Becoming something else. Something unknown.`,
  `When we create something, we've made a new THING. That's fairly straightforward. But when we break something, we've also made a new thing. Multiple new things. This object is not as it was, it is something else now. But we've also created the memory of the object that no longer exists. This constant mode of create/destroy/repeat is, in my opinion, what helps us all progress and learn.`,
  `This moment of progression within the process of creating things is what I'm trying to capture.`,
  `Maybe I should just start telling people that.`,
  `After all, a little confusion can lead to new things.`,
